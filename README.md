Hi there,

I started this project because the already existing WordPress plugins
for handling community websites didn't offer what I required.
I needed Gutenberg blocks I could customize in a way, that they would fit in my website's style.

At first I only began to build my own blocks which in fact was one of the hardest parts of this project.
I analyzed already existing blocks in WordPress to understand their mechanisms.

The plugin as it exists today is the result of all my ideas I got during making it.

After every step I think about the next step. There is no roadmap yet.
